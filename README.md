This program was written in Java 21 and needs JDK 21 installed to run

Currently, the waiting list detection only works for administrators on a Linux system. However, the game can still run on all platforms

The program should be run from the Main.java file however if anything with the detection breaks the game can still be run from the SnakeGame.java file
